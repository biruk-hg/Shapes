# Shapes
The "Shapes" project is a Java program designed to work with geometric shapes, specifically rectangles and triangles. The program defines two classes, Rectangle and Triangle, each representing their respective shapes, with methods for calculating area, perimeter, and checking specific properties like being a square or a right-angled triangle. The Shapes class serves as the main driver, where it initializes arrays of rectangle and triangle coordinates and creates corresponding objects. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles, encapsulating geometric properties and behaviors within distinct classes. It also includes functions to filter and print shapes based on certain conditions, such as identifying squares and right-angled triangles from the provided sets of coordinates. Overall, the "Shapes" project showcases how Java classes and objects can be utilized to model and analyze geometric entities efficiently.
