# Shapes
The "Shapes" project is a Java program designed to work with geometric shapes, specifically rectangles and triangles. 

Shapes1 defines two classes, Rectangle and Triangle, each representing their respective shapes, with methods for calculating area, perimeter, and checking specific properties like being a square or a right-angled triangle. The Shapes1 class serves as the main driver, where it initializes arrays of rectangle and triangle coordinates and creates corresponding objects. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles, encapsulating geometric properties and behaviors within distinct classes. It also includes functions to filter and print shapes based on certain conditions, such as identifying squares and right-angled triangles from the provided sets of coordinates. 

Shapes2 defines three classes: Point, Triangle, and Rectangle. The Point class represents a 2D point with x and y coordinates, the Triangle class models a triangle using three points, and the Rectangle class extends Triangle to represent rectangles. The program uses these classes to work with sets of coordinates for rectangles and triangles, calculating areas, perimeters, and identifying specific shapes based on certain conditions. The main Shapes2 class acts as the entry point, creating objects from the given coordinates and printing squares and right-angled triangles. The code exemplifies object-oriented principles, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. The Point class provides methods for distance calculation, utilized by the other classes for geometric calculations.

Shapes3 defines an abstract class Abstract representing a geometric shape with three points, an abstract getArea() and getPerimeter() methods, and a print() method for displaying the shape's coordinates. The Point class represents a 2D point with x and y coordinates and provides methods for printing the point and calculating the distance between points. The Triangle class extends Abstract and implements specific methods for calculating the area, perimeter, and checking if it is a right-angled triangle. The Rectangle class extends Triangle and adds methods for calculating the area, perimeter, and checking if it is a square. The main class Shapes3 serves as the entry point, creating objects from given coordinates and printing squares and right-angled triangles based on certain conditions. The code demonstrates the use of abstract classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, providing a structured approach to modeling geometric entities and their properties.

Overall, the "Shapes" project showcases how Java classes and objects can be utilized to model and analyze geometric entities in several ways, one being more efficient than the other.
